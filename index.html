					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Hi, I'm Robin. I have spent almost a decade teaching maths and economics, and have recently upskilled myself to move into software development. I have just finished studying on the <a href="https://io-academy.uk/courses/full-stack-track/" target="_blank" class="full-stack-track-link">iO Academy Full Stack Track</a> bootcamp. I am a hard working and friendly team player, with excellent interpersonal skills, and I am a particalarly strong communicator. I have been very successful in my time as a teacher, and I look forward to applying my many transferrable skills from the education sector into the world of coding.
